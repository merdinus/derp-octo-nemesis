			<p>This is my first paragraph. In being so, it is conspicuously vapid in 
				comparison to the rest of the text, as no-one bothers with the introductions 
				til the end anyway; or at least, not unless they get stuck or confused.</p>
				So anyway,<blockquote>
				<acronym title="ralph">This</acronym> is an example of a blockquote which is not inline, and is long!
				</blockquote>
				I'm mostly using these drawn-out bits of speech to test out the functionality
				of the paragraph function, activated by the use of the tag < p > (minus the spaces, 
				of course) and closed by the tag < / p >.</p>
				Of course, quoting html code like that is going to get annoying after a while, so the
				way round that little hiccup is to use the character entities recognised by many browsers.
				In this way, I can display the left code bracket as a less-than sign, signified by & l t ;,
				which displays as &lt;.
				The other end of this is & g t ;, which displays as &gt;.</p>
				I can also make this little bit of code identify itself to the casual reader by
				tricky application of the &lt;acronym&gt; function. Check this out: 
				I need to <acronym title="& l t ;">&lt;</acronym>p<acronym title="& g t ;">&gt;</acronym>.</p>
				Now I know this trick, fear hovering above any of my text, <acronym title="The devil sucks your mom's superdick in hell">EVAR.</acronym>
				<br>After much testing, I have decided that pre and blockquote don't play nice with each other.
				Scratch that. Pre and Notepad++ don't play nice with each other. Notepad++ automatically keeps code div-relational, but pre still pays attention to all that whitespace before your sentences. Gash le maxo. Guess I'll have to make more use of the &lt;br&gt; function if I write poetry, then...
